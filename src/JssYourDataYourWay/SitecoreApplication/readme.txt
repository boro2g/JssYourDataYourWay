Setup Nuget feed
Followed https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/90/sitecore-experience-manager/en/set-up-sitecore-and-visual-studio-for-development.html
Installed JSS https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_JavaScript_Services.aspx and added dlls to library (rather than nuget) as they didn't work
